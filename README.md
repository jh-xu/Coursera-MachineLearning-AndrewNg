# Machine Learning Course Assignments

This repository contains my assignments and projects for the [Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning#outcomes) offered by DeepLearning.AI and Stanford Online on Coursera.

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to machine learning. Through hands-on projects and exercises, I built and trained models using MATLAB while developing a solid understanding of fundamental machine learning techniques. The coursework covers both supervised and unsupervised learning methods, including linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, decision trees, clustering, anomaly detection, and recommender systems.
